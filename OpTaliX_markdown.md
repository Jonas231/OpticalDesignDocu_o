OpTalix is developed by Fritz Blechinger (Germany). It has a command syntax very similar to Code V. The [manual](http://www.optenso.com/download/optalix_reference.pdf) of OpTaliX is available online.

"To a maximum possible extent, the command syntax used in OpTaliX is compatible to CODE-V commands. In addition, there are a few commands not found in CODE-V which describe dedicated OpTaliX features."

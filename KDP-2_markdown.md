# Operands

Klein's optical design program was created by J. E. Klein. It was reverse engineered from "Hexagon" / "ACCOS-V" and has a similar command syntax and additional features. The user interface is a command line interface (cli) with some gui features. Both [KDP-2](http://www.ecalculations.com/) (Windows, iFort compiler), and its evolution [Koko](https://github.com/dinosauria123/Koko/) (Linux, Windows, gFortran compiler) are open sourced and Fortran77-based with some Fortran90.

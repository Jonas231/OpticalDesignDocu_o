    "\"The Reduce Tolerance Sensitivity (SAB, for Sensitivity As Built) control can be used in AUT for improving the as-built performance by using wavefront differential coefficients, for each tolerance at each field and zoom, to reduce the tolerance sensitivity of the optimized design. The SAB command allows you to specify a zoom number or range, field number or range, and aberration weight. CODE V then constructs a set of appropriate aberrations that are used internally during optimization. You may optionally specify the number of rays across the diameter for evaluating the ray grid (otherwise, 32 rays are used by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is generally applicable to any system for which the Wavefront Differential Tolerancing (TOR) option provides an accurate analysis of tolerance sensitivity. Prior to using the SAB error function in AUT, you should define tolerances and compensators for your optical system. As with other specialized optimization improvement features (such as MTF optimization), you generally should begin with a locally-optimized design. Some computational issues that you need to be aware of are discussed below.\n",
